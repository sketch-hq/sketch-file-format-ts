# Sketch File Format TS

> TypeScript types for the Sketch File Format

## Overview

This repo contains TypeScript types automatically generated from the [Sketch File Format](https://github.com/sketch-hq/sketch-file-format) JSON Schemas.

Types are maintained and exported for each Sketch File Format major version. See usage instructions below for more information.

## Use cases

- Strongly type objects representing Sketch documents, or fragments of Sketch documents in TypeScript projects

## Related projects

- [sketch-file-format](https://github.com/sketch-hq/sketch-file-format)

## Usage

Add the npm module using `npm` or `yarn`

```sh
npm install @sketch-hq/sketch-file-format-ts
```

Types for the latest file format are on the default export

```typescript
import FileFormat from '@sketch-hq/sketch-file-format-ts'
```

Types for historical file formats are accessible via named exports

```typescript
import { FileFormat1, FileFormat2 } from '@sketch-hq/sketch-file-format-ts'
```

## Examples

Create a typed layer blur object

```typescript
import FileFormat from '@sketch-hq/sketch-file-format-ts'

const blur: FileFormat.Blur = {
  _class: 'blur',
  isEnabled: false,
  center: '{0.5, 0.5}',
  motionAngle: 0,
  radius: 10,
  saturation: 1,
  type: FileFormat.BlurType.Gaussian,
}
```

Layer types can be narrowed using discriminate properties on the helper union types like `AnyLayer`

```typescript
import FileFormat from '@sketch-hq/sketch-file-format-ts'

const mapLayers = (layers: FileFormat.AnyLayer[]) => {
  return layers.map(layer => {
    switch (layer._class) {
      case 'bitmap':
      // type narrowed to Bitmap layers
      case 'star':
      // type narrowed to Star layers
    }
  })
}
```

Work with representations of Sketch files that could have a range of document versions

```typescript
import {
  FileFormat1,
  FileFormat2,
  FileFormat3,
} from '@sketch-hq/sketch-file-format-ts'

const processDocumentContents = (
  contents: FileFormat1.Contents | FileFormat2.Contents | FileFormat3.Contents,
) => {
  if (contents.meta.version === 119) {
    // type narrowed to file format v1, i.e. Sketch documents with version 119
  }
}
```

## Development

This section of the readme is related to developing the file format spec. If you just want to consume the schemas you can safely ignore this.

### Approach

The `scripts/generate.ts` ingests the file format JSON Schema, and generates type definitions using the TypeScript compiler API.

We depend on multiple major versions of the schemas in package.json using [yarn aliases](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/add/#toc-yarn-add-alias), and generate types for each one. This means that users that have to implement multiple versions of the file format don't need to manually manage multiple versions of this package.

### Scripts

| Script            | Description                               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| yarn build        | Builds the project into the `dist` folder |
| yarn test         | Build script unit tests                   |
| yarn format-check | Checks the repo with Prettier             |

### Workflows

#### Conventional commits

Try and use the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) convention when writing commit messages. This isn't enforced, but you can use the yarn commit command (in place of git commit -m "foo") to open an interactive CLI to walk you through generating a properly formatted commit message.

#### Changing how the types are generated

1. Update `scripts/generate.ts`
1. Unit test your changes
1. Determine the semver bump type and call yarn changeset to create an intent to release your changes (read more about changesets [here](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets)).
1. Open a PR to `master`

#### Adding or updating a file format version

1. Use the yarn aliases syntax to add new schema version
1. Use exact semvers, for example to update or add v3 of the schemas as `3.4.3` run,<br/>`yarn add @sketch-hq/sketch-file-format-3@npm:@sketch-hq/sketch-file-format@3.4.3`
1. If the schema version is new to the repo you'll also need to update the `index.ts` to export the types, and `scripts/generate.ts` to generate the new types
1. Open a PR to `master`

#### Release

1. Merge the release PR maintained by the changesets [GitHub Action](https://github.com/changesets/action).
